#SymmetricGroup

##What this Directory contains:

1. SymGroupElem.java - Object which represents an element of the n-th Symmetric Group. 

2. CycElem - Object which represents an individual cycle element of the n-th Symmetric Group (e.g. (1345)).

3. Driver - Random code where functions are tested.

4. SymDriver - Code which allows the user to multiply different cycles to see what the resulting element of the n-th Symmetric group is. Just time the cycles in consecutively (e.g. "(12)(345)(124)") and it will output the result. Press "q" to quit. (N.B. Currently you can only enter cycles contained in the 9-th Symmetric group, so no using 10+ in your cyles. I'll probably change this at some point.)
