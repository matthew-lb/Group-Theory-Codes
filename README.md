# Group-Theory-Codes

## What this is

This is a repository containing codes (and possibly in the future articles) written by me which pertain to Group Theory / Abstract Algebra which I find useful. It was initially inspired by my Abstract Algebra Homeworks and Midterm where I had to spend a lot of time evaluating products of elements in the n-th Symmetric Group. 

## What it currently contains

1. SymmetricGroup - Directory containing functions for working with the n-th symmetric group

2. Polynomials - Directory containing functions for working with polynomials (currently in development)

## Future Plans?

I may write an article on the conjugate action when I have free time. I might also do something that has to do with the action of the n-th Symmetric group on a polynomial in n-variables or some other invariant-theory flavored thingy. I might also look through the Sage Library and see if I can find any features I would like to implement / modify.
